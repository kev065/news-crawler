            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nLiverpool maintained their pursuit of Premier League leaders Chelsea as they moved to within six points of the pacesetters with victory over Manchester City at Anfield.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum's soaring eighth-minute header from Adam Lallana's cross was enough to put Liverpool in second place and put a serious dent in City's own title challenge.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp led the celebrations at the end of a game that was high on energy but sadly lacking in any moments of genuine quality.\n\nCity, who laboured throughout, improved in the second half but never seriously threatened Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and this loss leaves them 10 points adrift of Chelsea.\n\nKlopp gets better of Pep\n\nThis was the first Premier League meeting between two huge personalities straight from the top tier of management - and it brought a victory for Jurgen Klopp to cherish at Pep Guardiola's expense.\n\nThe head-to-head was locked at 4-4 after their meetings in Germany with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. This was a different stage with different prizes on offer - but it was an occasion that was just as charged.\n\nKlopp, in 15 months, has revitalised Liverpool and given hope to supporters longing to end the wait for a first title since 1990. And as they continue their pursuit of relentless Chelsea, belief continues to grow that the charismatic German can still haul in Antonio Conte's side.\n\nLiverpool's manager was, as usual, celebrating with his players after the final whistle before pumping his chest in mock relief in front of Anfield's huge new Main Stand.\n\nAnd, when City fleetingly threatened a second-half comeback, he turned cheerleader in front of those same fans with a demand to lift the noise levels that was met instantly.\n\nKlopp has become the new Anfield talisman. Under him, the transformation of his team and the mood around the club continues.\n\nSomething else that will give Liverpool's fans great heart is the way in which Klopp is getting results against his closest rivals.\n\nSince his appointment in October 2015, Klopp has faced a total of 13 Premier League games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. He has lost only one - a single goal defeat by United last season.\n\nHe has also enjoyed a Europa League win over two legs against United, although the balance is redressed slightly by a loss on penalties against Manchester City in last season's Capital One Cup final.\n\nLiverpool - and indeed Manchester City - are having to run to stand still in the Premier League title race, with Chelsea stretching their winning run to 13 games as they beat Stoke City earlier on Saturday.\n\nIt meant this was a game both sides needed to win - hence the contrasting emotions of Klopp and Guardiola at the final whistle.\n\nLiverpool are underdogs but six points is still a gap that can be closed and Chelsea have to visit Anfield on 31 January.\n\nKlopp's players have shown strength of character with their response to setbacks earlier this month, when they lost 4-3 at Bournemouth and drew 2-2 at home to West Ham.\n\nThey have also shown they can win in different ways. Recent victories over Middlesbrough and Stoke showcased a free-flowing style. At Everton and against City, they toughed it out - and answered questions about a supposedly vulnerable defence. It is evidence that Liverpool must be taken very seriously as title challengers.\n\nIt is far too early to dismiss a manager of Guardiola's ability - and a team of City's talents - in terms of the Premier League title race. However, the 10-point gap between themselves and Chelsea is starting to look as if it will only be overturned by extraordinary events.\n\nCity were too timid for too long here at Anfield. Sergio Aguero - returning after a four-match ban - was starved of service, while Kevin de Bruyne was marginalised and largely snuffed out by Liverpool's intense pressing style.\n\nIt was still David Silva who called the shots when they did put some moves together after the break but Yaya Toure could not exert serious influence.\n\nGuardiola's task should at least be put in context. City were a team short on inspiration and spark for much of last season under Manuel Pellegrini. Perhaps it was too much to expect even a manager of Guardiola's pedigree to apply an instant fix.\n\nCity should never be ruled out. But on the evidence of this flat performance - and the growing sense that significant renewal of the squad is still needed - dragging back Chelsea may be beyond them for this season.\n\n'I don't care about criticism' - what they said\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I know everyone talks about our defence. It's not about avoiding goals - that's the end product - it's about how we work together.\n\n\"I think we have the smallest number of shots on our goal in the league. Tonight the concentration level was outstanding.\n\n\"I don't care about criticism of our defence. You always pick out things that aren't right but that's how goals are.\"\n\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"It was an equal game. The goal made it difficult against a team who use the counter-attack like a master. The second half was much better.\n\n\"We have to wake up for another game. We need to focus and work - we can't think about the big goals.\"\n\nFormer England defender Phil Neville: \"It was a poor game. I was so disappointed by how poorly Manchester City passed the ball. They didn't get back into shape quick enough.\n\n\"Aleksandar Kolarov should have been winning that header against Georginio Wijnaldum. They were really poor in possession and well off the pace. Full credit to Liverpool, they set up deeper and didn't let City have possession.\"\n\u2022 None Liverpool have won four consecutive league games against Manchester City for the first time since 1981 (when they managed a run of seven).\n\u2022 None Pep Guardiola has now suffered twice as many league defeats this season (four) as he did in the entire 2015-16 Bundesliga campaign with Bayern Munich (two).\n\u2022 None Manchester City have kept just four clean sheets in their 19 Premier League games under Guardiola.\n\u2022 None Liverpool have scored 87 league goals in 2016; their most in a calendar year since 1985 (also 87).\n\u2022 None Adam Lallana has made seven assists in the Premier League this season (in 17 appearances); his most in a single campaign.\n\u2022 None Lallana also ends 2016 having been involved in 21 goals in the Premier League (11 goals, 10 assists); no midfielder in the competition has had a hand in more.\n\nA swift turnaround. City host Burnley at 15:00 GMT on Monday, while at the same time Liverpool are at struggling Sunderland.\n\u2022 None Delay over. They are ready to continue.\n\u2022 None Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi (Manchester City) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked. Divock Origi (Liverpool) right footed shot from outside the box is blocked. Assisted by Roberto Firmino. Navigate to the next page Navigate to the last page",

            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "Waxing pubic hair has become increasingly common, but how did the trend for the \"Brazilian\" wax begin?\n\nIn an office toilet in London, young women discuss their grooming regimes. Jennifer, 19, waxes off all her pubic hair every month. \"The pain is the worst thing I've ever been through, but I'm kind of used to it now,\" she says.\n\n\"I prefer the underneath being gone,\" says Lisa, 27. \"Some people wax for the beach and other people wax for boys, and people who wax for boys wax the underneath.\"\n\nEver since Sex and the City tackled the subject, what women do with their pubic hair - trim, shave, pluck, wax or let it all hang out - has become a topic for discussion. And scientific research.\n\nStudies show that pubic hair grooming is becoming increasingly common. Earlier this year researchers reported in JAMA Dermatology that 84% of the American women who took part in their survey had done some grooming, with 62% removing all of their pubic hair. Younger women were much more likely to groom than the over-40s.\n\nAn earlier study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine linked the phenomenon to the availability of pornography. This same study suggested that the trend originated in South America - \"hence the term Brazilian as slang for complete pubic hair removal\".\n\nBut that is not the whole story.\n\n\"The Brazilian bikini wax was born here in New York, not Brazil,\" says Jonice Padilha, of the J Sisters salon in Manhattan, which pioneered the treatment in the early 1990s.\n\nA Brazilian wax involves removing all the pubic hair from underneath and leaving some hair at the front for decorative purposes - perhaps a triangle, a thin \"landing strip\" or a heart-shape, that's up to the customer. \"It's a freedom for you to have whatever you want,\" she says.\n\nJonice is the youngest of seven Brazilian sisters whose names all begin with J - the others are Jocely, Janea, Joyce, Juracy, Jussara and Judseia. They became known collectively as the J Sisters because nobody could get all the names right. Today the salon is popular with the rich and famous, and they make up to $6m a year on waxing, hair and nail treatments. But it had humble beginnings.\n\n\"It's an inspirational story of self-made women who came from nothing, illegal immigrants who made it in America,\" says Laura Malin, author of Wax and the City, a forthcoming book about the J Sisters. \"It's the American dream.\"\n\nThe sisters come from the small coastal town of Vitoria, which lies between Rio and Bahia. They grew up in a large family - seven sisters and seven brothers - and in a traditional, macho culture. Their father forbade them from going out unchaperoned, and was afraid it wasn't safe for them to work for other people, Jocely says.\n\nBut when he went bankrupt, his daughters began to bring in money by offering beauty treatments in their back yard. Eventually they became the main breadwinners, and ran three salons in the town. \"After school I used to hang out in the salon, instead of going to friends' houses,\" says Jonice.\n\nIn such a traditional household, it seemed that the only way to leave home was to get married, but Jocely, the fourth sister, dreamed of seeing the world. She saved up and in 1982 went to New York to visit an old neighbour from Vitoria. She planned to stay for a month, but the few hundred dollars she had brought ran out in a matter of days. She faced a choice: fly home or start earning.\n\nShe could have been in trouble. \"New York was a lot more violent then and many Brazilian women were prostitutes, so there was this prejudice,\" says Malin. Luckily, Jocely had skills.\n\nStreet art by Sandrine Boulet shows a female contour drawn around grass on a pavement\n\nShe spoke no English, but found a job at a nail salon run by a Portuguese woman. At the time the fashion was for stick-on acrylic nails which would be removed weeks later, leaving quite a bit of damage. Jocely's focus was on restoring the nail's natural health and lustre. Her reputation for manicures spread and she attracted a powerful customer - Adnan Khashoggi. The arms-trade magnate would book her for the entire day, at a rate of $100 an hour, so he could have manicures between meetings. Through him she met many influential people, from stars such as Brooke Shields and Rod Stewart to the editors of fashion magazines like Elle and Marie Claire.\n\nSoon she was earning well and, one by one, her sisters came over to join her. Jonice was the second to come to New York. She was dazzled. \"It was when I arrived here that I realised Brazil was Third World,\" she says. \"We knew nothing.\"\n\nIn 1987 the sisters opened their first nail salon on 57th St between 5th and 6th Avenue, then considered a fairly undesirable location. People thought they were crazy, says Jonice. At the time you didn't need a licence to run a nail salon so it was the obvious place to start, but they had other beauty secrets to impart. A few years later, at the start of the '90s, they began offering their - as yet unnamed - extreme bikini wax. It removed all pubic hair from below, not just at the sides.\n\nTheir signature wax had been invented by their sister Janea. \"It's a funny story actually,\" says Malin. Back in the late '70s Janea was in Bahia with her husband, having a beer and some fried fish on the beach. She was admiring a beautiful girl, but as she walked past Janea was horrified by the pubic hair protruding from the back of her tiny bikini. \"The image - it was like a mirror that shattered,\" says Malin.\n\nJanea's next thought was: \"Wow, do we have hair there?\"\n\nAt home her suspicion was confirmed. But when she went to a salon to have it removed, she met with resistance: \"Are you crazy? I'm not touching you there,\" was the response.\n\nSo Janea decided to do it herself. She locked herself in the waxing booth with a mirror and after about three hours of painful experimentation came out feeling fabulous. Then she convinced her co-workers to do the same. \"They were like: 'Oh my god I don't feel ashamed when I'm in bed with men, I don't feel shame when I go to the doctor, I feel cleaner,'\" explains Malin.\n\nWhen they introduced it in New York, their bikini wax became wildly popular. It helped that they still counted the editors of fashion magazines among their customers. \"Our only error was not to call it the J Sisters wax,\" says Jonice.\n\nBut there was a problem - they were coming under pressure from rivals. The early '90s had seen a boom in online porn, which increasingly featured hairless actors and models. \"It's very practical for pornography but it's just very practical for sex,\" adult film-maker Anna Span told the BBC. Adult magazines such as Playboy and Penthouse also showed little or no pubic hair.\n\nJonice says Playboy called the salon, claiming they had come up with the idea first. \"They said: 'This is ours, we do this for the porno site,'\" she says. Jonice's defence was to say that it was just what everyone in Brazil did. \"I said we were introducing our culture,\" she says.\n\n\"That's why all over the world it's known as a Brazilian. I played it that way so they would leave me alone. But it started here, not there.\"\n\nPeople haven't forgotten that the J Sisters were the real pioneers. They were consulted for shows like Gossip Girl and Sex And the City.\n\n\"Sarah Jessica Parker came here all the time,\" says Jocely.\n\nThey count many celebrities as close friends.\n\n\"They have very intimate relationships with people,\" says Malin.\n\n\"If you spread your legs to a woman then you don't have anything else to hide. I've been there so many times and you end up talking about everything: depression, kids, anal sex... It's crazy and a little bit therapeutic.\"\n\nAs well as Malin's book, a biopic about the sisters is in production in Brazil - a \"dramedy\", or comic drama, say the producers. \"They were very brave to leave this small town in Brazil and go to New York with no money and no English,\" says Karen Castanho, one of the producers. \"They have such energy, I've never met anyone like them.\"\n\nFemale body hair is a recurring theme in the work of French street artist Sandrine Boulet\n\nSo what does the future hold for the Brazilian wax?\n\nThe trend could be on its way out. A recent study has linked pubic grooming to an increase in sexually transmitted infections. The GB cycling team banned bikini waxes during the Olympics because the hair protects against chafing. Even Tatler magazine recently announced the return of the natural look.\n\nBack in the London office toilet this, too, has been noticed. \"Boys are saying: 'Don't do it, if you shave it all off you look like a baby,\" says Alex, 23. Her friend Cameron, 21, agrees. \"Yes, my friends say they like bush because they feel more mature being with that person.\"\n\nBut the J Sisters always move with the times. For the past 10 years they've been waxing men. And since Jocely discovered her first grey hair down there, the salon can also dye pubic hair, to prevent the kind of home-dying mishaps featured in Sex and the City. One thing's for sure, thanks to their influence this part of the body will never again be neglected.\n\nSome names have been changed.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.\n\u2022 None BBC - Future - Why do we have pubic hair-\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nPremier League leaders Chelsea equalled the top-flight record of 13 consecutive wins in a single season by beating valiant Stoke in a thriller at Stamford Bridge.\n\nAn exceptionally entertaining second half included five goals as the Blues were twice made to retake the lead by a Potters side who gave them one of their toughest tests this season.\n\nGary Cahill gave Chelsea the lead when he headed in shortly before half-time, but Stoke defender Bruno Martins Indi levelled only a minute after the break when he poked in from close range.\n\nWillian handed the Blues the advantage again only for Peter Crouch to level with a side-foot effort high past Thibaut Courtois.\n\nStoke barely had time to celebrate, as moments after the restart Chelsea drove towards goal with Willian applying a fierce, angled finish.\n\nWith five minutes remaining, the Blues all but sealed the three points when Diego Costa - magnificent as a target-man - shrugged off the attentions of Martins Indi to fire in the fourth.\n\nChelsea have a six-point lead over second-place Liverpool who defeated Manchester City 1-0 in the late Saturday game.\n\u2022 None All the reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\n\nChelsea up for the fight\n\nThis was a brutal test for Antonio Conte's men.\n\nStoke were organised and disciplined at the back and threatened at the other end. In fact, until Cahill's goal they were the better team and looked more likely to score first.\n\nTheir spirit was not broken even after Cahill's opener, and seconds after the interval Martins Indi converted his first for the club from Crouch's nod-down.\n\nChelsea's potent attack compensated for their failings at the back, and 11 minutes later Victor Moses and Hazard combined before Willian poked in.\n\nBut yet again Stoke, who had not won a league game at Stamford Bridge since 1974, fought back. This time it was Crouch who got on the scoresheet in the league for the first time since May 2015 when he tucked home under pressure.\n\nStoke had gone a remarkable 56 games without an Englishman scoring until Crouch's second-half effort. The longest English goal drought belongs to Arsenal, standing at 97 games until Theo Walcott's brace in a 2-2 draw with Birmingham in February 2008.\n\nHowever, Conte's Chelsea have shown great resolve this season. Just a minute after the second equaliser, Cesc Fabregas found Willian in the area and he rifled in from a tight angle.\n\nWith five minutes remaining, Costa finally got his reward for an outstanding display with a close-range strike past the reach of goalkeeper Lee Grant.\n\nStoke threw everything at them and came away with nothing - but they will take some solace that they were playing the best in the league.\n\nThere was a moment late in the second half when 6ft 2in Spain forward Costa was involved in what seemed a minor altercation with a Stoke defender in the opposition area. That 'moment' was swiftly ended by the alert refereeing of Bobby Madley.\n\nBut would it have become more serious? Because the Costa of this season is very different to the Costa under the old management of ex-Blues boss Jose Mourinho.\n\nHis Achilles heel was confrontation, but all his aggression appears now to be channelled towards simply outmuscling those who dare to mark him.\n\nMartins Indi - 6ft 1in and equally stocky - was given that task at Stamford Bridge and did a good job until the 85th minute when, like a rugby forward trying to make a try-saving tackle, he lost his grip of Costa, who punished him with Chelsea's fourth.\n\nBut it is unlikely Martins Indi will be given such a workout by any other striker for the rest of the season.\n\nChelsea's lead man has great feet plus pace, channelled aggression and now 14 goals this campaign. A contender for player of the season?\n\n'Numbers are not important if you do not win the title'\n\n\"Congratulations go to my players. To win 13 games in a row in this league is very difficult.\n\n\"Stoke played very well. They hit long balls to Crouch and fought for the second ball. My players showed they can adapt to the different kinds of game we face. They showed great commitment, work-rate and will to win. I'm delighted for them.\n\n\"Now, it's important to celebrate the arrival of the new year, then to think of the next game against Tottenham.\n\n\"Numbers are not important if you do not win the title. Now, they are fantastic and we are proud, but we must concentrate on the second part of the season.\"\n\n\"It's a similar story to our efforts at Liverpool. We got back level, but then conceded poor goals. We've made mistakes and good teams punish you.\n\n\"I thought we did really well, showing courage to get back in the game. I thought we were good value to get a draw, but we can't keep on making the mistakes we are at the moment because it's hurting us.\n\n\"We were positive, got back level and it was up for grabs. For their third goal, the ball went through about four of our players. We can't keep defending as we are in key moments. If we take that out of our game, we will be fine.\n\n\"Mistakes happen, the opposition can affect what you do. You have to understand the time, the moments of the game.\"\n\nStats you need to know\n\u2022 None Chelsea are just the second Premier League team in history to win 13 consecutive games in a single season, following Arsenal in 2001-02.\n\u2022 None Fabregas registered his 100th Premier League assist - the fourth player to achieve this feat (Ryan Giggs - 162, Frank Lampard - 102, Wayne Rooney - 101).\n\u2022 None Fabregas was the quickest player to reach 100 Premier League assists, however (293 apps).\n\u2022 None It's the first time Fabregas has assisted in back-to-back Premier League games since January 2015.\n\u2022 None Costa has had a hand in 19 Premier League goals (14 goals, five assists) this season.

Tottenham may feel aggrieved their New Year fixture falls on New Year's Day, as had it been 24 hours earlier and they won, they would be second.\n\nManchester City miss out on the top four, while 2015-16 title winners Leicester are eighth after a difficult run between August and December.\n\nAt the other end - excluding the promoted and relegated teams - Crystal Palace, Watford and Swansea make up the bottom three, with Palace 11 points behind their closest rivals.\n\nJurgen Klopp has made a big impact since arriving at Liverpool in October 2015 - and that impact is becoming clearer with every passing month.\n\nIn 2016, his team have scored the most goals...\n\n...had the second-highest number of shots (659), more than 60 ahead of Man City (596), West Ham (574) and well clear of Chelsea (552).\n\n...and they are up there in terms of highest average possession...\n\nSo what more do Liverpool have to do to end what may soon be a 27-year wait for a title?\n\nWhich players topped the stats for 2016?\n\nQuiz question for you: which three English players outscored Leicester striker Jamie Vardy in the Premier League in 2016?\n\nThe other one? West Ham's Michail Antonio! Top marks if you got that one.\n\nAnd here's a tip for Fantasy Football players. Get Cesar Azpilicueta in your team.\n\nFor starters, the Chelsea defender has played the most minutes in the Premier League in 2016 (tied with Leicester's Wes Morgan, Bournemouth's Steve Cook and Manchester United's David de Gea). Southampton's Virgil van Dijk was also level with that bunch until he was sent off late in their final fixture of the year on Saturday.\n\nSpaniard Azpilicueta has also had more touches than any other player...\n\n...and is second on the list for completed passes, behind only Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson. He also features in the top 10 for tackles made and successful passes in the opposition half.\n\nAway from the teams occupying the top six in the Premier League, there have also been plenty of stellar performances. West Ham's Dimitri Payet - one of the stars of 2015-16 - created the most scoring opportunities, 28 more than his closest rival - Tottenham's Christian Eriksen.\n\nAlong with Arsenal's Mesut Ozil (111), they were the only three players to create more than 100 chances in 2016.\n\nAt the other end, the two keepers with the best shots-to-saves record do not belong to top-six clubs.\n\nAnd finally, a few names for Fantasy Football devotees to avoid. These players repeatedly found themselves in trouble with referees in 2016, with Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye the most-booked Premier League player of 2016.\n\nDespite that poor disciplinary record, he was not one of the 47 players sent off during the calendar year. Forty-six of those were dismissed once, while Vardy and Tottenham midfielder Victor Wanyama hold the dubious honour of being the most-dismissed players of the year - both were sent off twice.",

            "section": "Asia",
            "content": "Japan's press demand public apologies, whether by perpetrators or people connected to them\n\nApologies are common in Japan, indeed it is virtually a cliche about the country. But 2016 has seen some controversial public acts of contrition - notably parents standing up before the public to say sorry for their adult children's alleged criminal offences.\n\nYuzuha Oka explores what lies behind this phenomenon.\n\nJapan's corporate apology culture is already well known and deeply rooted.\n\nMany people will be aware of the shazai kaiken, or \"apology press conferences\", where business chiefs read a profoundly apologetic statement lowering their heads and bowing deeply to their audiences.\n\nBut what are less known are the public apologies given by Japanese parents called on to stand up and be accountable for the actions of their children - no matter how old they are.\n\nIn late August, actress Atsuko Takahata delivered an emotional apology for her 22-year-old son, who was arrested over an alleged sexual assault. He was released without charge, but before the process even began his mother stood up to tell the public that she must hold partial responsibility for any alleged actions.\n\nAtsuko Takahata delivered an emotional apology at a press conference in August\n\nIt echoed a 2013 apology by TV presenter Mino Monta, who even resigned from his shows when his 31-year-old son was arrested over an attempted theft.\n\n\"I feel a moral responsibility as a parent,\" Mr Mino said at the press conference.\n\nBut this public ritual is by no means confined to celebrities. In July, after the shocking mass stabbing of 19 people at a home for people with mental disabilities in Sagamihara, the offender's father issued an apology statement at his workplace.\n\nYears earlier, in 2008, when a 25-year-old man killed seven in a crowded Akihabara shopping street his parents made an apology in front of their home.\n\n\"Our son has committed a grave crime. We sincerely apologise to those who were killed and injured,\" they said.\n\nThe press shutters snapped as the parents bowed.\n\nWhile the parental apology in Japan is of course linked to the psychology of simply taking responsibility, it is also a custom that traces its roots back to the samurai era.\n\nKnown as the Enza rule, the punishment of criminals' family members took place in 15th and 16th Century Japan. The warrior samurai enforced their lords' reign over the peasantry by extending punishments to transgressors' families.\n\nThe notion of collective responsibility was extended even further during the Edo period, between the 17th and 19th centuries. Five neighbouring households were group into one unit and made responsible for each others taxes - and crimes.\n\nPenalties were meted out to the entire unit if anyone committed an offence.\n\nCorporate misdeeds are a frequent occasion for public shows of contrition in Japan, as seen here with Mitsubishi Motors executives\n\nAlthough the law was abolished when the Edo period ended in 1868, its legacy encouraged a mindset of being responsible for \"seken\", or \"the public\", says sociologist Naoki Sato, professor emeritus at Kyushu Institute of Technology and an expert on seken studies.\n\nHe explains that seken is a notion very particular to Japanese society, where people are expected to follow a number of unspoken rules to live in harmony. One of them urges a criminal's parents to feel responsible for seken even when they did nothing wrong themselves.\n\nHe also points out what he says are differences between Japanese and Western parent-child relationships. While parents in Western countries see their children as individuals, Prof Sato says Japanese parents tend to think of their children more like their possessions, and feel that they own their children's misbehaviour.\n\nCertainly it is rare to hear of parents apologising for the sins of their children globally.\n\nWhen two students at the University of Oklahoma triggered a storm by reciting a racist chant, one of their parents issued a public apology. It was seen as remarkable enough that at least one commentator wrote an opinion piece asking if parents should apologise more for their children's actions.\n\nYoshiko Mita stayed off TV for ten months after her son was held over a drug offence\n\nBut in Japan the pressure to atone for the sins of your relatives can be so strong that families are sometimes hounded by journalists and vociferously condemned by the public.\n\nIn the 2008 Akihabara stabbing case, the criminal's younger brother was reported to have committed suicide after suffering stress, having been chased by the media even after moving and changing jobs several times.\n\nAnd Ms Takahata's apology spurred a debate on whether parents should be held so responsible.\n\nWhen TV Asahi's Morning Show asked 50 people on the street about the case, 60% answered \"it's his own problem, not his mother's\".\n\nA similarly mixed reaction was also found on social media.\n\nThe press quickly assembled at the home of Satoshi Uematsu after his July killing spree at a care home for the mentally handicapped in Sagamihara\n\n\"I'm fed up with an apology when someone has not done anything. I want them to either urge their grown-up son to take responsibility or raise him up once again from zero,\" said one user on Twitter.\n\nJapanese youth are certainly concerned with taking control of their own lives but the culture of \"shazai kaiken\" and taking responsibility for seken is still deeply rooted in society.\n\nSo you can expect more apologies.",

But in this game of chess, the Telegraph says, President Putin did nothing.\n\nThe Financial Times says that instead of retaliating against Washington's biggest expulsion of his diplomats for more than a decade, the Russian president suggested he was no longer taking Barack Obama's administration seriously - and was instead focusing on building ties with President-elect Trump.\n\nBut the Guardian thinks Mr Trump now faces a dilemma because if he decides to end the sanctions, it would put him at odds with his own party. If he leaves them in place, he would find himself at odds with Mr Putin.\n\nThe Telegraph leads with a warning from the head of the NHS in England that \"selfish\" partygoers who get \"blotto\" are putting intolerable strain on the service.\n\nThe paper quotes Simon Stevens as saying the system is being treated as the \"national hangover service\", and that services already under pressure are being compromised by those determined to enjoy themselves to excess.\n\nMeanwhile, The Times has carried out research that it says shows Britain is facing a crisis in recruiting head teachers, with thousands leaving the profession or retiring early because of high pressure and insufficient pay. It found that one in 10 schools is losing its head teacher each year.\n\nAccording to the paper, rural councils said heads were tempted elsewhere by bigger salaries and urban authorities said candidates were shunning schools because of the high cost of living.\n\nMany papers also look back to the events of 2016.\n\nFor The Times, it was the year of revolution: the political elite was roundly humiliated, people voted for radical change and surprised everyone, including themselves, by getting it.\n\nThe Sun says some still believe that Brexit was the worst event of 2016, but that they couldn't be more wrong.\n\nIt suggests a New Year might be an ideal moment for these people to finally accept the political landscape has shifted and that Britain can be first to capitalise on its positives.\n\nThe Guardian describes 2016 as the year most would like to forget - but it says there were silver linings, such as Sri Lanka becoming the latest country to be declared free of malaria.\n\nFinally, a film buff inspired by the glory days of cinema has fulfilled a life-long ambition by opening one in his back garden.\n\nAnderson Jones, from Stoke-on-Trent, built the 34-seat cinema from scratch - complete with a projection room, toilets and foyer with concessions stand.\n\nAccording to the Daily Express, everything from the seats to the ticket machines and exit sign has been reclaimed from the old ABC cinemas.\n\nMr Jones's wife, Jayne, tells the Mirror she's going to be in charge of the sweet counter and handing out the ice creams at the interval.",

            "description": "Hull may not be famed as a cultural hotspot, but its status as UK City of Culture in 2017 is aiming to change that.",
            "section": "Entertainment & Arts",
            "content": "A massive road improvement scheme has already turned some locals against City of Culture\n\nHull may not be famed for its culture, but it is hoping its status as UK City of Culture in 2017 will transform the city's image and fortunes for years to come. But building work on some facilities will not be finished for months, and some locals have yet to be won over.\n\n\"Here for the culture. You're only here for the culture. Here for the cuuultuuure\u2026\"\n\nOn 23 November 2013, three days after Hull won a government competition to find the UK City of Culture for 2017, Hull City AFC fans bellowed this chant towards supporters of the visiting team that day, Crystal Palace.\n\nIt was self-deprecating. It was ironic. Hull City did not play cultured football, and surely no-one would travel from London to Hull for the actual culture.\n\nBeen there, done that, bought the T-shirt...\n\nThree years on, the slogan \"You're only here for the culture\" is printed on colourful T-shirts and fridge magnets in the Hull 2017 merchandise stand in the city's branch of House of Fraser.\n\nBut part of the irony has been replaced by something else - pride, perhaps; triumphalism, even.\n\nHullensians will wear those T-shirts knowing that some people they pass in the street will have travelled to the city from another part of the country for the culture, and only for the culture. Some might have even come from London.\n\nThat is the intention behind City of Culture. To bring people in who may not have visited before, and to change the minds of people who had a fuzzy image of this East Yorkshire port city, informed mainly by negative things - the decline of the fishing industry, being named the worst place to live in the UK, the number one Crap Town.\n\nHull is the second UK City of Culture - a title that is being awarded every four years. The first was Derry-Londonderry in 2013.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nHull's reign begins on 1 January with an outdoor spectacle telling the story of the city using projections on buildings, and a firework display at 20:17 GMT that they say will be bigger than London's New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nDuring the year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is taking up residence, drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo have been loaned by the British Museum, Opera North is turning the Humber Bridge into a giant musical instrument and 60 arts projects will be embedded in local communities.\n\nTrinity Market arcade has been turned into an unofficial Hull walk of fame\n\nIf you are sceptical about how much culture Hull has given the world over the years, go to Trinity Market, an indoor arcade in the old town.\n\nThis is Hull's unofficial walk of fame. On the walls between and above the record shop and sweet cabin hang more than 180 black picture frames containing photos of anybody and everybody from Hull who has gone on to great things.\n\nPioneering aviator Amy Johnson is next to David Bowie's guitarist Mick Ronson, anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce and actress Maureen Lipman.\n\nThere is poet Philip Larkin, film director Anthony Minghella, playwright John Godber and actor Barrie Rutter.\n\nSandwiched between pop groups The Beautiful South and Everything But The Girl hang Hull Kingston Rovers legend Roger Millward and trailblazing gay poet Elsa Gidlow.\n\nHull 2017 director Martin Green says it will help growth in Hull for the next 30 years\n\nThe frames were put up by Steve Mathie, who runs Spin-It Records and has published a book titled The Famous Side of Hull.\n\nHe says visitors to the arcade fall into two camps. \"You've got people [from outside Hull] who are surprised, and you've got the local people who are proud,\" he says.\n\n\"They bring visitors in to have a look and say, 'Look, this is what Hull's done'. All day long you're hearing, 'Oh, I didn't know that', which is really nice.\"\n\nHe says being City of Culture is about more than the shows that will be staged over the next 12 months.\n\n\"It's going to take the city forward and the city's going to be big,\" he says. \"It's going to be very successful.\n\n\"Next year, that's just the whistles and bells. The firework display that's happening on New Year's Day - that's the start of the next 10 years for Hull.\"\n\nBut not everybody is going to be buying the T-shirt.\n\nTo get ready for 2017, the council has spent 2016 digging up and relaying many of the city centre streets.\n\nThe orange roadwork barriers have become a major source of pain and have soured City of Culture before it has even begun for some who live and work in the city.\n\nNext to Spin-It Records, Deborah Denby has run Debbie's Sweet Cabin for 25 years. The disruption caused by the building work has meant her trade is down 75% this year, she says.\n\nShe initially thought City of Culture might be good for Hull. \"But at the moment I don't think so,\" she says. \"I was excited. I'm not now.\"\n\nThe council's mantra to business owners like Mrs Denby is that it is \"short-term pain for long-term gain\".\n\n\"Yeah, that's all they've said to us. 'Ride the storm.' Easier said than done, believe you me,\" she says.\n\n\"We wanted to be positive and the majority of businesses will still want to be positive, but all the hard work we've put in over the years, and then they've just knocked it like that, doing all this work together. I hope they can prove us wrong.\"\n\nBarry Jackson, in his hand-stitched hat, volunteers in a City of Culture booth in the train station\n\nIn the train station, a City of Culture booth has been set up to give information to visitors and locals alike.\n\nPart-time taxi driver Barry Jackson, 65, one of the volunteers manning the booth, is wearing a purple woolly hat bearing the hand-stitched slogan: \"Hull City of Culture\".\n\n\"This came from the highest authority,\" Mr Jackson explains. \"My wife. She made it.\"\n\nMost people who come into the booth want to see City of Culture work, he says.\n\n\"They want to see it expand the city, media-wise [for it] to be known better. They want the good parts to be seen.\n\n\"Every city's got its bad parts. But we've got a lot to give here. You will get your complainers. They're few and far between. When we first started, there was a few of them. We hear hardly any now.\"\n\nHis fellow volunteer, retired plumber Alan Balcam, fetches a poem by Margaret Crossland titled This Is Hull. \"Or to put it in the vernacular - This Is 'Ull.\"\n\nThe poem talks about how: \"We hate orange barriers/As they dig up the town/We all like to grumble/As we traverse around.\"\n\nBut also how: \"Our time in the spotlight's/Arriving at last/Look to the future/As well as the past.\"\n\nThe \u00a316m redevelopment of Hull New Theatre will not be finished until August or September\n\nThe council says 65% of the roadworks will be finished by 1 January, including all the routes for the opening outdoor spectacle. The rest will be completed by Easter - but the council also stresses the \u00a325m scheme was always planned to be carried out in two phases.\n\n\"We are trying to do what would under normal circumstances be a three- or four-year programme of works,\" according to Councillor Martin Mancey, the cabinet member responsible for public realm works.\n\n\"We are trying to cram that all into less than two years, obviously because we want to maximise the advantage we're gaining from this in terms of all the City of Culture visitors coming next year.\"\n\nThe Ferens art gallery has had a \u00a35.1m facelift\n\nAs well as smartening up the city centre, the council has given the Ferens art gallery a \u00a35.1m refurbishment. It will reopen on 13 January with pride of place going to its prize acquisition - a 14th Century masterpiece by Pietro Lorenzetti.\n\nThe Lorenzetti will be accompanied by four loans from the National Gallery and others from the Victoria and Albert Museum, Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and Barber Institute of Fine Arts in Birmingham.\n\nThe council also runs the New Theatre, which is having a \u00a316m facelift to make it fit for major touring shows - but that will not be ready until August or, more likely, September.\n\nAnd a brand new 3,500-seat concert and conference complex - named Hull Venue - will not open until early 2018.\n\n\"In an ideal world of course everything would have been completed by 31 December and all the new venues would be open,\" Mr Mancey admits.\n\nBut he adds: \"This is not all about what goes on between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017. This is about planning for the future and ensuring that significant visitor numbers keep coming back to the city because they see it as an attractive place with a lot to offer.\"\n\nPaul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott are headlining a gig at the KC Lightstream Stadium in June\n\nCity of Culture director Martin Green stresses that all plans are running to schedule - even if that schedule says certain things will not be ready for the start of the year.\n\n\"Projects like this kick off the growth and renaissance of cities for the next 25-30 years and if you're serious about that then you build that for 30 years,\" he says.\n\nMr Green says he is not disappointed that the New Theatre will not be available to stage shows for most of the year, insisting it \"works very well\" to have focal points throughout the year.\n\n\"If everything happened on 1 January, you'd have nothing to say for the rest of the year.\"\n\nTwo redeveloped venues have already reopened. The University of Hull's 400-seat concert and film venue Middleton Hall and the Brynmor Jones Library, where Larkin once worked, were part of the university's \u00a3200m redevelopment.\n\nThe University of Hull has borrowed historic drawings from the British Museum\n\nFrom 3 January, the library's gallery will host an exhibition of drawings by some of the greatest artists in history. Look along the rows of frames and the star names come thick and fast - Michelangelo, da Vinci, Rembrandt, Picasso, Rubens, Rodin, Moore...\n\nThey have been loaned by the British Museum, and the director of the university's art collection, John Bernasconi, says Hull's year as City of Culture had inspired the university \"to aspire to a higher level than we might otherwise have done\" when staging exhibitions.\n\nThat becomes slightly less impressive, however, when you discover that this is a touring exhibition and the last place it was seen was that other underappreciated coastal hotbed of culture, Poole in Dorset.\n\nMartin Green takes pride in the fact that there will be at least one cultural thing happening in Hull every day during 2017 - and usually more than one.\n\nHumber Street has been the scene of regeneration, with art and music venues and specialist bars and cafes\n\nThere have been other grumbles, though - all of which Mr Green bats away.\n\nSome artists who have lived and worked in Hull for years complained at being turned down when \u00a3750,000 funding was shared between 60 community arts projects. But there were 650 applications, Mr Green says.\n\nThe ticketing website was not working properly at first. There were \"some teething problems\" but it will serve the city for years to come and is now fixed, he promises.\n\nSome have said the line-up is a bit too high-brow. But 15,000 tickets for ex-Housemartins and Beautiful South frontman Paul Heaton's stadium homecoming sold on the first day; Richard Bean's new play The Hypocrite - a co-production between the Hull Truck theatre and the RSC - has just extended its run by a week; and Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, featuring Hull-born Spiders From Mars drummer Woody Woodmansey, sold out straight away.\n\n\"My job now is to make sure we deliver on the promises and ideas. I'm confident we can deliver what we've promised to deliver.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nCeltic came from behind to beat Old Firm rivals Rangers and move 19 points clear at the top of the Premiership.\n\nKenny Miller slid in to convert James Tavernier's cross and put the home side ahead early on.\n\nMoussa Dembele's powerful shot from a Scott Sinclair corner flashed high into the net to bring Celtic level, and Dembele later fired against the bar.\n\nThe visitors dominated the second half, and Sinclair touched home Stuart Armstrong's low cross for the winner.\n\nMark Warburton's hosts showed from the outset their intention was to press their opponents in wide areas, and it paid dividends when Josh Windass released Tavernier to set up Miller's close-range finish.\n\nCeltic continued to concede too much space in the full-back areas, and further deliveries troubled goalkeeper Craig Gordon and his defence.\n\nHowever, Dembele's leveller put Celtic into the ascendancy and Rangers then struggled to get Barrie McKay and Tavernier on the ball, though McKay did draw a save from Gordon after the break.\n\nHaving struggled to get a telling delivery at set-pieces, Rangers may have gone ahead just before Celtic's second as Danny Wilson met Tavernier's corner, Gordon making the save.\n\nCeltic duo to the fore again\n\nSummer signings Dembele and Sinclair had run the Rangers defence ragged in September's 5-1 win at Celtic Park, and the duo's link-up play was again the catalyst as the visitors recovered from their early setback.\n\nSinclair's set-piece was controlled and rattled into the top-right corner by Celtic's top scorer Dembele - a fifth goal against Rangers for the Frenchman this season.\n\nAnd he should have taken that tally to six after Mikael Lustig squared the ball to the striker early in the second period, a miskick allowing Wes Foderingham to save.\n\nFoderingham came to Rangers' rescue when James Forrest was played in on goal by Stuart Armstrong but Sinclair would ensure a happy end to 2016 for his team, applying the finish to Armstrong's piercing ball across the face of goal.\n\nArmstrong, Sinclair and substitute Nir Bitton forced further saves from Foderingham as Rangers continued to struggle in defence.\n\nIn a match of so many chances, it was a surprise there were only three goals.\n\nSinclair fired against the right-hand post as Celtic trailed, and Dembele's downward volley bounced up on to the crossbar at 1-1, with Sinclair firing the rebound wide.\n\nAnd, after Sinclair had netted, Rangers were also left frustrated by the goal frame as Miller's shot came back off the same post Sinclair had hit in the opening half.\n\nThe Scottish Premiership enters its winter break for the early part of January and Celtic can extend their advantage at the top to 22 points if they win their game in hand against St Johnstone near the end of next month.\n\nThe league leaders, who have won 15 Premiership matches in a row and have only dropped two points all season, are targeting a sixth straight top-flight title win and a first under manager Brendan Rodgers.\n\nFor Rangers, they suffer their first competitive home defeat since September 2015 and face a battle to hold on to second place with Aberdeen, who have a game in hand, two points behind them.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved. Andy Halliday (Rangers) left footed shot from outside the box is saved in the top centre of the goal.\n\u2022 None Danny Wilson (Rangers) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Moussa Dembele (Celtic) wins a free kick on the right wing.\n\u2022 None James Tavernier (Rangers) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved.

            "content": "From a majestic natural spectacle to a high-octane technological thrill ride, here's our guide to the big science events of 2017.\n\nIf reports are to be believed, 2017 will offer up what's been described as the eclipse of the century.\n\nIn August next year, skywatchers from all over the world are expected to converge on the United States for this spectacular cosmic event.\n\nThe excitement is understandable, since it's the first such eclipse with a path of totality crossing from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts since 1918.\n\nOver the course of one-and-a-half-hours, the Moon's shadow will trace an arching path from Oregon in the west diagonally downwards towards South Carolina.\n\nIn addition, several large urban centres, such as St Louis, Missouri, and Nashville, Tennessee, lie in the path of the eclipse.\n\nThere isn't much cutting-edge science to be done on eclipses, but next year's event is sure to provide one of the greatest natural spectacles in recent memory.\n\nIn 2017, one of Nasa's most successful ever missions will build up to a dramatic end. The Cassini spacecraft was launched in 1997, arriving in orbit around Saturn in 2004.\n\nThe array of discoveries made during the mission is staggering: giant hurricanes at Saturn's poles, geysers erupting from the icy moon Enceladus, rain, rivers and seas on the planet's biggest satellite Titan.\n\nBut starting at the end of 2016 and continuing through early 2017, Cassini will carry out more than 20 dives at the outer edge of the majestic ring system that surrounds Saturn.\n\nThis will give scientists the opportunity to study the rings in unprecedented detail.\n\n\"We have two instruments that can sample particles and gases as we cross the ring plane, so in a sense Cassini is also 'grazing' on the rings,\" said Linda Spilker, Cassini's project scientist.\n\nThey will also be able to observe the menagerie of small moons that orbit in or near the edges of the rings.\n\nIn April, Cassini will begin repeated dives through the narrow gap between Saturn and its rings. Finally, on 15 September, the probe will end its mission by plunging through Saturn's atmosphere - a finale designed to prevent it crashing into potentially habitable moons and contaminating them with any Earth bugs that have hitched a ride.\n\nIt should be a thrilling and spectacular ride.\n\nThe British Bloodhound project aims to smash the land speed record with a rocket-powered car.\n\nThe project has already been delayed several times, but the team behind the record attempt will be hoping that 2017 is their lucky year.\n\nMost of the car is already built; most recently, the team has been testing the car's fuel system.\n\nPowered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle should be subjected to trials at Newquay Airport in the UK in July and then Hakskeen Pan in South Africa later in the year.\n\nThe British team wants to accelerate the car to 800mph, exceeding the current land speed record, by the end of the year.\n\nThen, after a hiatus, the car should return to South Africa in 2018 to achieve its ultimate goal of breaking the 1,000mph mark.\n\nA British car being entered for next year's World Solar Challenge won't need to get anywhere near those speeds. But it will require impressive feats of engineering to drive the sleek vehicle 3,000km through Australia's interior.\n\nWill this be the year that Elon Musk's SpaceX launches its Falcon Heavy rocket? The super heavy-lift launcher was first mentioned in 2005, but the date for its maiden flight has slipped several times, most recently because of the explosion of SpaceX's smaller Falcon 9 rocket in September.\n\nWhile Musk's company works to successfully return that rocket to flight in 2017, it's just possible that we might see its more powerful cousin launch next year. The rocket, which effectively consists of three combined Falcon 9 boosters, is designed to lift heavy payloads into orbit, including the heaviest commercial and military satellites - and, perhaps one day, crewed spacecraft.\n\nBut the repeated delays have prompted some interested commercial customers to look at other options for planned satellite launches over the next few years.\n\nThe demonstration launch could either occur from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California or Kennedy Space Center in Florida. With so much else in play at the moment, SpaceX may further delay the launcher's debut.",

            "section": "World",
            "content": "A lot has gone wrong this year. We don't mean Brexit or the election of Donald Trump, both of which split opinion in Britain and the US.\n\nWe mean the thousands of migrants who died in the Med, the war in Syria, Zika virus, terror attacks all over the world, the hottest temperatures ever recorded. And, as if all that wasn't bad enough, David Bowie died.\n\nSo from the BBC World Service Inquiry programme here are four things that went right in 2016 from the perspective of four people who helped make them happen.\n\nFour stories united by just one thing: the ambition to achieve the seemingly impossible.\n\nDuring the 50 years of war in Colombia, most people there have been touched by it in some way. But some more than others.\n\nTwelve members of Teresita Gaviria's family were killed, including her father and two brothers. Then one day, her fifteen-year-old son was kidnapped on the way to school. She never saw him again.\n\n\"I went into the mountains shouting, 'Give me my son back,'\" she says. \"I wanted to die from the pain.\"\n\nTeresita Gaviria with pictures of disappeared relatives in Medellin, Colombia in 2013\n\nTeresita Gaviria started a weekly protest in front of a church. At first there were just five mothers who had lost children to the war.\n\nSoon there were hundreds. And they did more than just protest. They went to prisons to speak to fighters, and lobbied the government to not only begin peace talks, but to include victims in the negotiations.\n\nAnd they were successful. Teresita Gaviria and other victims were invited to Cuba where the negotiations were held.\n\nThere, they sat in front of members of the Farc and talked to them. Never before, in any other peace process anywhere in the world had this happened. \"It was hugely important for us,\" she says. \"The victims needed to confront the perpetrators.\"\n\nThis year, a peace deal was reached. It has been described as groundbreaking, partly because of the victims' contribution. Like most peace deals, it has its critics, but it is a beginning.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. President Santos and Farc leader Londono were met with cheers of \"Yes we could!\"\n\nTeresita Gaviria was there at the ceremony when it was signed. \"It was a moment of sheer happiness,\" she says. \"The bloodshed had finally come to an end. We were bursting out of our clothes with joy.\"\n\nProfessor Sophien Kamoun is a plant biologist from Tunisia. He has always been interested in plant diseases, particularly after seeing the devastating effects of pesticides in developing countries.\n\nEvery year, thousands die after using pesticides on diseased crops. What if you could create a type of plant that doesn't get diseases?\n\nThat's what Sophien Kamoun has been experimenting with in his lab at Norwich University, using a new technique invented in the US that came of age this year - gene editing. It allows scientists to modify the genes of living things like plants.\n\nProfessor Kamoun experimented with editing the genes of a tomato plant so that it would no longer be susceptible to a particular disease.\n\nFirst they isolated the gene that makes the tomato vulnerable to that disease. Then they removed the gene from the genome of the tomato. \"And it became resilient to the fungal disease,\" he says.\n\nGene editing is an incredibly powerful tool. There are real concerns about how such a technology could be used, but regulate it properly, and you could change the way we feed the world.\n\n\"Every year we lose enough food to feed hundreds of millions of people to pathogens and parasites,\" he says. \"If we could make some of our crops more resilient, then that would be an unique achievement.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIt is not only plant biologists who are experimenting with gene editing: doctors are using it to reverse the mutations that cause blindness, to stop cancer cells from multiplying and to make cells resistant to the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nIt is why some have called gene editing the invention of the century.\n\nIn 2009, the Sri Lankan government decided to do something extraordinary: to try to eradicate malaria in less than five years.\n\nDr Hemantha Herath was one of those leading the campaign. He spent years going round the country treating people with malaria.\n\nThe lucky ones survived. The unlucky ones could fall into a coma and die. That is why the government wanted to get rid of malaria completely. They had tried to do it before, but when the civil war broke out in the 1980s, health workers couldn't get to the worst affected areas.\n\nWhen the war ended in 2009, the government saw an opportunity. They decided to track down every last case of malaria, including people who did not even know they had it. It was a bold strategy which no other country had tried.\n\nThey tested any patient who came to a hospital who had had a fever in the past. If they had malaria, not only would they be treated, but their family would be tested and their home sprayed with insecticide.\n\nThen health workers went after the mosquitoes themselves. And to catch them, they offered themselves up as bait.\n\nThose efforts paid off. This year it was made official: Sri Lanka is now malaria-free. For Dr Herath, it was a moment of great pride. \"We showed to the world that malaria can be eliminated.\"\n\nWhen Bertrand Piccard was little he was scared of heights. One day, he decided to cure himself by hangliding.\n\nHe didn't just conquer his fear of heights: he became obsessed and was soon leaping off 3,000m high mountains, doing hang glider acrobatics.\n\nBertrand Piccard was determined to fly around the world without using any fuel\n\nAged 40, he travelled non-stop around the world in a hot air balloon. He made history, but didn't like having to burn propane gas to keep the balloon airborne.\n\nHe made a promise: the next time he flew around the world it would be with no fuel. Concerned about rising carbon dioxide emissions, he wanted to show what clean technology could do.\n\nAnd so the idea for a solar-powered plane was born.\n\nSeventeen years later, after working on several prototypes, his plane was ready. On its outside were over 17,000 solar cells.\n\nEarly one Monday morning, Solar Impulse 2 took off from Abu Dhabi airport on the start of a 35,000 km journey round the world; a journey powered by nothing but the sun.\n\nBertrand Picard and co-pilot Andre Borschberg took turns to fly. By day they flew by the power of the sun.\n\n\"It's really a fantastic experience,\" he says. \"You look at the sun, and on your left and your right you have the propellers turning, and you know you have no fuel.\n\n\"It's only the sun that makes you fly. You produce no pollution and you can fly theoretically forever.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Solar Impulse coming in to land in Abu Dhabi\n\nBy night they flew on the electricity stored up from the sun during the day. \"You just hope you have enough to reach the next sunrise,\" he says.\n\nOne night they got down to the last 5% of battery life. \"Those were the moments of my life where I felt the best,\" Piccard says. \"This is the magic of adventure!\"\n\nOn 26 July this year, Bertrand Piccard landed back in Abu Dhabi. After 17 years of planning, and 23 days of flight, he'd done it: flown the first solar-powered plane all round the world.\n\nA few months later he created the World Alliance for Clean Technologies. The flight may have been over, but for Bertrand Piccard, a new project had begun.\n\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays.

            "content": "It's been held up as a particularly gloomy year for celebrity deaths. But has the grim reaper really claimed the souls of more notable people than usual in 2016?\n\nFor their admirers, 2016 has been a sad year.\n\nBack in April, the BBC's Obituaries Editor Nick Serpell was tasked with checking if there was anything unusual about the number of well-known people dying, as many on social media had been claiming.\n\nHe counted the number of pre-prepared BBC obituaries that ran across radio, TV and online from January until the end of March for the years 2012-16.\n\nAnd at that point he found that, yes, just looking at the first three months of the year, there had been a huge increase.\n\nTwice as many notable people had died in this period of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, and five times as many as in 2012.\n\nIt's worth bearing in mind that this is quite a crude way of measuring celebrity deaths.\n\nThe BBC doesn't do an obituary for every celebrity that dies and, as already noted, Serpell only counted pre-prepared obituaries, rather than obituaries written after the event, or news reports that mention someone has died.\n\nThen there's also the question of who even counts as a celebrity in the first place. US television personality David Gest, for example, did not get a BBC obituary.\n\nNonetheless, as the year draws to a close, it seems an appropriate time to ask - has 2016 continued to be so dangerous and fateful for famous people?\n\nAcross the whole year, there was just over a 50% increase in BBC pre-prepared obituaries used in 2016 compared with 2015.\n\n\"In 2012, we had a total of 16,\" says Serpell. \"In 2013, it went to 24. In 2014, it rose again to 29. In 2015, it rose slightly again to 32.\" For 2016, as of 30 December, it stands at 49.\n\n\"Just under half those deaths occurred in the first three months of the year,\" says Serpell.\n\nThe rest of the year looked like it was settling back down to be on a par with 2015. However, there was yet another spike of notable deaths over the Christmas period when seven more people died within a two-week period.\n\nSo 2016 has seen the largest number of famous people die, but it was those bumps at the beginning and the end of the year that made it so unusual.\n\nAlthough there does seem to have been an inexorable rise, Serpell says there hasn't been any change in the BBC's policy on what sort of person qualifies for an obituary.\n\nHe thinks that the increase isn't particularly surprising, because we're now half a century on from the flourishing of both TV and pop culture in the 1960s, which massively expanded the overall pool of public figures.\n\nYou're going to have to get used to hearing the celebrity obituary.\n\nPre-prepared BBC obituaries that ran on television, radio and online\n\nThis article was initially published on 16 December and had been updated to reflect subsequent deaths.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "The past year saw Canadians back their own culture like never before.\n\nCanadian culture has always been a bit of a mystery, even to Canadians.\n\nWe're not particularly fond of flag-waving, and it's rare to hear rowdy chants of \"Ca-na-da! Ca-na-da!\" break out at a bar unless, of course, the hockey game is on.\n\nBut over the course of the past year, Canadians have made concerts national events. They have attended playoff games in droves, cheering on their teams and jeering anyone foolish enough to doubt them. And when the Toronto Blue Jays had a hot streak, Canadians become some of the loudest supporters of America's favourite pastime, baseball.\n\nMaybe blame it on Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe telegenic prime minister began 2016 on the heels of a selfie-filled election victory and a flashy Vogue Magazine cover. Tongues wagged - wasn't the whole thing a little too tacky, a little too American?\n\n\"Playing dress-up for the photo was silly\" tweeted one particularly grumpy journalist.\n\nBut the celebrity treatment was only getting started.\n\nEverywhere Mr Trudeau goes, he's surrounded by a throng of people, Canadians and foreigners alike, eager to take their picture with him. When he visited Washington for a state dinner, his meeting with outgoing president Barack Obama was heralded as a bromance for the ages.\n\nToronto rapper Drake has made it big abroad, but he still supports his hometeam, the Toronto Raptors.\n\nWhile Trudeau's popularity is by no means assured at home, his rising star has caused more than a few media pundits to ponder the once-unthinkable: could Canada be cool?\n\n\"It's all very exciting, eh? But still \u2026 Canada? The land of hyper-politeness and constant apology? The home of maple syrup, poutine, the gentle sport of curling and 10% of the world's forests?\" the New York Times gently scoffed earlier this year.\n\nFans of the Toronto Raptors certainly seem to think so. The basketball team has developed a reputation for having some of the most devoted fans in the NBA, who proudly and loudly chanted the team's slogan \"We the North\" throughout the team's historic playoff run.\n\nAdding to the frenzy was the appearance of Toronto rapper Drake. As the Raptors' celebrity ambassador, he showed up one night for a surprise performance when the team took on the Indiana Pacers.\n\nIt was the apex of Raptorsmania, and for the rest of the team's playoff run, fans would randomly scream Drake's name during the game as if calling on the messiah.\n\nBut nothing quite rallies Canadian fans together more than feeling slighted.\n\nWhen the Raptors were left out of a CBS Sports poll on who would win the championship, it triggered a Twitter hashtag: #WetheOther.\n\n\"Please don't hesitate to have your people call my office to get prime camera positions for the parade after the Toronto Raptors win the NBA Championship,\" Toronto Mayor John Tory wrote to CBS Sports. \"We will mark their space as 'other.'\"\n\nThat love for the underdog is partly what helped endear the band The Tragically Hip to so many Canadian fans over the years, and sparked national mourning when frontman Gord Downie announced he had terminal brain cancer this spring.\n\nFans openly wept, and everyone from Mr Trudeau to actor Will Arnett expressed their condolences.\n\nWhen the band announced they would tour this summer to promote their latest album, they were greeted with the kind of fan frenzy usually reserved for secret Beyonce album releases.\n\nGord Downie is known for his flashy outfits as well as deep lyrics\n\nTickets sold out in minutes, and soon the biggest story about the Hip wasn't Downie's cancer, but whether scalpers were ruining the show for true fans.\n\nBut while Downie, with his feathered hats and reference-heavy songs like \"Bobcaygeon\", may seem like an odd choice for a national icon, his disregard for the trappings of American pop stardom helped cement his status as a truly Canadian legend.\n\n\"[Interviewers] always ask us about our success or lack of success in the States, which I find absurd,\" Downie said once. \"While that is a story of the band, there are so many other stories.\"\n\nAlmost 12 million people tuned into the live broadcast of the tour's final concert in Kingston, Ontario. For about three hours on that summer night in August, a third of the country stopped what they were doing and listened to the band play.\n\nIt was the kind of cultural touchstone that happens only once in a generation, if that.\n\nAfter the first encore, the rest of the band left the stage, leaving Downie alone with the audience as wave after wave of applause poured over him.\n\nIt was so deafening; it was almost like silence.",
